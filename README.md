# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
The purpose of EDA is to summarize the main characteristics of the data and gain insights to inform further analysis or decision-making.

---

## Objectives
1. Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. Identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
3. Detect missing values and outliers.
4. Generate meaningful visualizations for better data interpretation.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.9
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Advanced visualizations based on Matplotlib.


 Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- Import the dataset using Pandas.
- Inspect the first few rows using `.head()`.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Rename columns for clarity if needed.
- Convert data types where necessary.

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
- Summarize numerical data using `.describe()`.
- Explore categorical variables using `.value_counts()`.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - Histograms for numerical variables.
  - Count plots for categorical variables, using bar and pie charts
- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  - Box plots to observe distributions across categories.
  - Scatter plots for relationships between variables.
- **Multivariate Analysis**:
  - Correlation heatmaps to explore relationships.
  - Pair plots, bar plots, line plots for variable interactions.
